      Hey Tols, I just want to say that I am bad at this type of stuff, which is why kaya nahihiya aq kanina kasi i've been thinking of what i should do for u this valentines. First of all, i've been seeing u sa Perps for awhile na way back pa sa ballroom, I just couldn't bring myself to ask for your name, but when i saw u dun sa practice nung ballroom dance, i felt kinda happy for some reason. I just wanna apologize rin for being this shy kasi this is kinda new for me, but forsure i'll bawi to u rin soon. So ayon HAHSWHSHWHSHAHAHWHA I wanted to take a moment to express my feelings to you, as I developed a crush on you, this is my way of properly confessing to you, and my intentions towards you are pure. From the moment I met you, I was drawn to your infectious smile and sparkling personality. I admire your passion for life and the way you approach everything with positivity. To be honest I don't expect anything in return naman I just wanna express my feelings for you, and hopes that you would know how worthy and pretty you are. Here's a little playlist i made for u open.spotify.com/playlist/7yYbA3zJ9QzOxZ2FFDyinw?si=8f7eec94a78c4dbe
