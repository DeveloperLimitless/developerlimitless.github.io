<h2>To Berna,</h2>

<p>
You already know how I feel about you, so this isn’t really a confession anymore. 
I guess this is just me putting into words the things I genuinely want you to know.
</p>

<p>
I’m really proud of you — more than you probably realize. I see how brave you are every day, 
especially with everything you handle at work and in life. Being a dealer isn’t easy, yet 
you still show up, stay strong, and carry yourself with confidence even when things get stressful. 
That’s something I truly admire about you.
</p>

<p>
What I like most about you isn’t just your smile or the moments we talk, but your strength 
and the way you keep moving forward no matter what. You have this courage that makes people 
respect you, and honestly, it makes me admire you even more.
</p>

<p>
I may not always say things perfectly, but one thing I’m sure of is how I want to treat you — 
with patience, respect, and care. I want to be someone who gives you peace, someone who supports 
you when you’re tired, and someone who reminds you that you don’t always have to be strong alone.
</p>

<p>
I’m not rushing anything or asking for promises. I just want you to know that my feelings 
for you are genuine, and that I truly appreciate the person you are.
</p>

<p>
You deserve to be treated right, and if you allow me, that’s exactly what I want to do.
</p>

<p class="closing">
Sincerely,<br>
Nico
